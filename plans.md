# Peedeefy – Product Plans

## Overview

**Peedeefy** is a browser-based PDF utility suite focused on privacy, speed, and simplicity. All core features run entirely on the client side with no file uploads to a server. The platform starts as a static web app hosted on GitHub Pages and is designed to evolve into a full SaaS offering.

## Core Principles

* Client-side processing (privacy-first)
* No user accounts required for MVP
* Simple, single-purpose tools
* Fast and reliable for everyday PDF tasks
* Clear separation between free and paid value

---

## MVP (Free – Launch Scope)

These features define the initial public release and must be stable, fast, and intuitive.

### PDF Management

* Merge multiple PDFs into one
* Split PDF by:

  * Page ranges
  * Individual pages
* Reorder pages within a PDF
* Delete selected pages

### Conversion

* Images (PNG/JPEG) → PDF
* PDF → Images (PNG/JPEG)

### Compression & Optimization

* Basic PDF compression
* Simple quality presets (Low / Medium / High)

### Preview & Download

* Page thumbnails and preview
* Instant download of processed files

### General

* Drag-and-drop file upload
* Clear processing states (loading / success / error)
* Works fully offline after initial load (where possible)

---

## Free Tier (Post-MVP)

These features remain free long-term but may be introduced after MVP.

* Rotate pages
* Extract selected pages into a new PDF
* Basic metadata viewer (title, page count, size)
* Light watermark (optional, non-intrusive)

---

## Paid Features (Planned)

These features define the monetization layer and will be gated behind payment.

### Advanced PDF Tools

* OCR (image-based PDF → searchable text)
* Password protect PDF
* Remove password (where permitted)
* Add text/image watermarks
* PDF annotation (basic highlight, notes)

### Conversion Pro

* PDF → Word
* PDF → Excel
* PDF → PowerPoint

### Batch & Limits

* Batch processing (multiple operations at once)
* Higher file size limits
* Faster processing priority

### Privacy & Storage (Optional)

---

## Enterprise / Advanced (Future)

* API access
* Team plans
* White-label tools
* Self-hosted version

---

## Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope for MVP)

* User accounts
* Cloud file sync
* Collaboration features
* Document signing

---

## Monetization Strategy

* Free tier remains useful and unrestricted for basic tasks
* Paid tier focuses on power users and professionals
* No ads in core workflows
* Clear upgrade prompts only when relevant

---

## Naming & Branding Notes

* Product name: **Peedeefy**
* Brand tone: Clean, professional, trustworthy
* Focus on privacy and correctness over gimmicks

---

## Technical Constraints

* Static hosting (GitHub Pages initially)
* Client-side only for MVP
* Architecture must allow backend introduction later without rewrite

## Revision Policy

This document is expected to evolve as features are validated and user feedback is collected.
